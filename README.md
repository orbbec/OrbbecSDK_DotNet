# Orbbec SDK DotNet Wrapper

This is a wrapper for the Orbbec SDK for DotNet. It supports .NET 8.0 and later versions, and is compatible with Windows and Linux platforms. 

It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for accessing the Orbbec camera and performing various operations such as capturing depth images, color images, and performing point cloud generation.

The v2-main branch is based the open source version of [Orbbec SDK v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2). 


**If you need to use .NET Framework, please use [this repository](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_CSharp). However, .NET Framework is maintained for bug fixes only, and no new features will be added. We recommend using Orbbec SDK DotNet Wrapper instead.**

# Support Platforms

- Windows: Windows 10 (x64), tested with .NET 8

- Linux: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04, with .NET 8

# Environment Setup

Please refer to [this document](https://orbbec.github.io/OrbbecSDK_DotNet/source/2_installation/Compilation.html#orbbecsdk-dotnet-wrapper-compilation) for compilation instructions.



## windows
For windows, you need to register the metadata associated with frames (this includes things like timestamps and other information about the video frame).

- Metadata registration follow this:[/scripts/obsensor_metadata_win10.md](scripts/obsensor_metadata_win10.md)

*Notes: If the metadata is not registered, the device timestamp will be abnormal, thereby affecting the SDK’s internal frame synchronization functionality.*


## Linux

For Linux, we have provided a script to help you set up the environment. You can run the script as follows:

```bash
cd scripts
  sudo chmod +x ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger
```

*Notes: If this script is not executed, open the device will fail due to permission issues. You need to run the sample with sudo (administrator privileges).*
